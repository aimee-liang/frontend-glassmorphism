### Frontend-Glassmorphism

#### Background
I wanted to design a Frontend site to incorporate a new trend I've seen on LinkedIn and YouTube called Glassmorphism. Glassmorphism offers a sleek and minimalist design that's popular nowadays, especially with companies that target Millennials and Gen Z. 

With this in mind, I created a web app for a fictional design studio called conscience using Game of Thrones characters as the leadership for this business.
